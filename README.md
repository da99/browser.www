I had to abandon this project...
==================================

Despite my best efforts in trying to create an easy way to write AND test
JavaScript code, I found out it would be best to first start w/ Purescript:

* unit tests + JavaScript < integration tests + PureScript
* incomplete specifications are better than starting w/no specifications
* it was taking too long to finish
* even if it were possible, the performance would suffer compared to
  code "checked" by the PureScript compiler.
* "Unchecked" Branching, if/else, etc. would still be used, introducing more bugs.

The best way would be to first start w/PureScript, and create a YogiBranch/DumDumProof
version in PureScript after I get comfortable.

* integration tests + PureScript
